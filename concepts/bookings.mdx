# Bookings

The booking system is the core transaction mechanism of the Tattoo API, handling appointment scheduling, payment processing, and status management between clients and artists.

  <Step title="Payment Processing">
    Deposit or full payment is processed through Stripe integration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Booking is confirmed and both parties receive notifications
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completion">
    After the appointment, booking is marked as completed
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Booking Object

A comprehensive booking contains all appointment and transaction details:

```json Booking Example
{
  "id": "booking_abc123",
  "client_id": "client_456",
  "artist_id": "artist_789",

}
```

## Booking Status Workflow

Bookings progress through a well-defined status workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[pending] --> B[confirmed]
    A --> C[canceled]
    B --> D[in_progress]
    B --> C[canceled]
    D --> E[completed]
    D --> F[no_show]
    E --> G[requires_followup]
    C --> H[refunded]
```

### Status Definitions

| Status | Description | Allowed Transitions |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **pending** | Initial booking request awaiting payment | confirmed, canceled |
| **confirmed** | Booking confirmed with deposit/payment | in_progress, canceled |
| **in_progress** | Appointment currently happening | completed, no_show |
| **completed** | Appointment finished successfully | requires_followup |
| **canceled** | Booking canceled by client or artist | refunded |
| **no_show** | Client didn't show up for appointment | - |
| **refunded** | Payment has been refunded | - |
| **requires_followup** | Completed booking needs additional care | - |

## Conflict Detection

The booking system automatically prevents scheduling conflicts:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Artist Availability" icon="calendar-check">
    Ensures artist is available at requested time
  </Card>
  <Card title="Studio Hours" icon="clock">
    Validates booking is within studio operating hours
  </Card>
  <Card title="Buffer Time" icon="hourglass">
    Maintains required buffer time between appointments
  </Card>
  <Card title="Block Scheduling" icon="ban">
    Respects artist's blocked/unavailable time slots
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Conflict Resolution

When conflicts are detected, the system provides alternatives:

```json Conflict Response
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "scheduling_conflict",
    "message": "The requested time slot is not available",
    "details": {
      "requested_time": "2024-02-15T14:00:00Z",
      "conflict_type": "artist_unavailable",
      "suggested_alternatives": [
        {
          "date": "2024-02-15T16:00:00Z",
          "duration_available": 240,
          "artist_preference": "high"
        },
        {
          "date": "2024-02-16T14:00:00Z", 
          "duration_available": 300,
          "artist_preference": "medium"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Payment Integration

Bookings are tightly integrated with the payment system:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Deposit Bookings">
    Most bookings require a deposit (typically 30-50% of total cost) to secure the appointment. The remaining balance is collected before or after the appointment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Full Payment Bookings">
    Some artists or studios require full payment upfront, especially for smaller tattoos or first-time clients.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Payment Plans">
    For larger tattoos, the system supports payment plans with multiple scheduled payments leading up to the appointment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cancellation Policies">
    Each booking includes cancellation terms, with deposits often non-refundable within 48-72 hours of the appointment.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Booking Features

    A --> E[Analytics Engine]
    A --> F[Artist Scheduling]

## Best Practices

<Tip>
